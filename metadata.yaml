description: "Rural Rides is the book for which the English journalist, agriculturist\
  \ and political reformer William Cobbett is best known.\nAt the time of writing\
  \ in the early 1820s, Cobbett was a radical anti-Corn Law campaigner, newly returned\
  \ to England from a spell of self-imposed political exile in the United States.\n\
  Cobbett disapproved of proposals for remedies for agricultural distress suggested\
  \ in Parliament in 1821. He made up his mind to see rural conditions for himself,\
  \ and to \"enforce by actual observation of rural conditions\" the statements he\
  \ had made in answer to the arguments of the landlords before the Parliamentary\
  \ Agricultural Committee.\nHe embarked on a series of journeys by horseback through\
  \ the countryside of Southeast England and the English Midlands. He wrote down what\
  \ he saw from the points of view both of a farmer and a social reformer. The result\
  \ documents the early 19th-century countryside and its people as well as giving\
  \ free vent to Cobbett's opinions.\nHe first published his observations in serial\
  \ form in the Political Register, running from 1822 to 1826. They were first published\
  \ in book form in two volumes in 1830.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
